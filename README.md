# ML Project

This project is an example of using Apache Spark for machine learning tasks. It includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load data from a CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
2. **Data Processing**: Process the data by dropping unnecessary columns and converting the label column to a numeric type.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and test sets.
4. **One-Hot Encoding**: Perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
5. **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test data using AUC-ROC.
